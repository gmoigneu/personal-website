title: "AGENT.md: Why your README matters more than AI configuration files"
description: "The AGENT.md specification emerged in July 2025 as an attempt to solve a real problem: developers maintaining separate configuration files for each AI coding tool (.cursorrules, .windsurfrules, CLAUDE.md, and more). Created by Sourcegraph's Amp team, AGENT.md promises \"one file, any agent\". A vendor-neutral standard to unify AI assistant configuration. But a surprising truth has emerged: the proliferation of AI configuration files has inadvertently revealed that most projects have terrible documentation, and fixing your README is more important than adopting any new standard."

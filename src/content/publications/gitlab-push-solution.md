title: "Synchronize your air-gapped GitLab with Upsun"
description: "When your GitLab instance isn't accessible from the internet, you can't use Upsun's standard GitLab integration. Instead, you can create a GitLab CI/CD pipeline that pushes code to Upsun and manages environments through API calls. This approach gives you full control over your deployment process while maintaining the security of your private GitLab instance."

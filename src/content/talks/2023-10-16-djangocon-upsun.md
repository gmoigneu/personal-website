Deploying an app for the first time is always daunting. It does not need to be. We will setup a quick ChatGPT client based on a Django REST API and a React frontend. These app will be deployed to Upsun where we will analyze some performance bottlenecks and scale the infrastructure appropriately based on these findings.
